                <p> Hi, my name is Ryan Lennert. I am currently enrolled in Coding Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania.
                    I am taking the course in order to acquire skills so that I may switch careers in the future. Currently
                    I work a full time job as an Assistant Manager at Sherwin Williams. I have been at the same store for
                    the past three years (the first two years I was just part time) and think it is time for a change in
                    my career path. </p>
                <p>
                    I made this page using HTML and CSS. I was able to make most of it using from just what I have learned in the first week
                    of class. I ran into problems getting the navigation bar to operate correctly, so I sought outside help
                    online.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now I am going to talk a little bit about the paint store I work in just to fill space. Currently my store is the 13th largest
                    out of 80 stores in the Philadelphia district. The sales volume is around 1.5 million dollars per year.
                    We typically sell around 4,000 gallons of paint a month, with that number increasing in the summer and
                    decreasing in the winter. Our store is unique in the sense that there is no loading dock, so every week
                    when we get our delivery of paint, it has to be unloaded in the parking lot out front.
